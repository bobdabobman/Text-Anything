If you haven't already, create an account and get a phone number from twilio. Specify this number in  this repository at textanything/terraform/variables.tf

This code automatically deploys when merged or pushed to main when using the Jenkins server set up in the other repository: jenkins. Follow the steps to set up the Jenkins server and then code naturally.
